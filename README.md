# winning-bet-odds
Calculates the odds of winning a bet given certain conditions by using random number generation simulated 10,000 times.
Imagine you are walking up the stairs with a friend at the Q1 Tower in Queensland, Australia. You are playing a game with your friend where you throw a dice 100 times. If the dice roll is a 1 or 2, you will go down one step. If it is 3, 4, or 5, you will go up 1 step. If you roll a 6, you roll the dice again then walk up the resulting number of steps.

It’s obvious, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you are a bit clumsy thus have a 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means you have to start again from step 0.

You bet your friend that you’ll reach at least 60 steps up after 100 dice rolls. What is the percentage chance that you will win the bet?

This project utilizes Python packages Numpy and Matplotlib. It utilizes random simulations to calculate the percentage odds of reaching a specified end point given the specifications in the project brief.
